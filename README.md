# Optimal_Deflation_Varimax

This deposite is the implementation of experiment results in our paper [Optimal vintage factor analysis with deflation varimax]( https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10545).

+ Run *compare_initialization.m* and *compare_ini_converge.m* to reproduce figure 4 and 5 respectively.
+ Run *compare_method.m* and *grad_improvement.m* to reproduce figure 6 and 7 respectively.

We use codes from [DL_focm](https://github.com/sunju/dl_focm) and [fast-ica](http://research.ics.aalto.fi/ica/fastica/) to compare our method with ADMM and fast-ica respectively in estimating loading matrix in simulation.

Codes are written by Xin Bing, Dian Jin and Yuqian Zhang. Contact dj370@scarletmail.rutgers.edu if there exist any problem.
